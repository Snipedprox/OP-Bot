## Discord Multi-Purpose Bot
OP Bot is a bot designed to keep your server safe and active. Its moderation and logging suite keep track of your members and keep your moderators accountable. Its auto-meme capabilities also allow it to stand out from rest of the discord bot's. Finally, OP Bot is designed to be fast and easy to use.

## How do I report a bug or suggest a feature?
Feel free to open an issue with your bug report or feature request, with as many details as possible. If you'd like to write a feature, please open an issue first for discussion. For help with the bot, Try joining support server or using the command `opbug <query>` or `opsuggest <suggestion>`.

## When will the bot be open-source?
I will make the bot open-source when it touches **200+ server**.

## Can I self-host OP Bot after that?
I wouldn't recommend it. Self-hosting this bot (running a copy yourself) is not supported, and no help will be provided for editing nor compiling the code in this repository. The source code will be provided here for transparency about how the bot's primary features work. If you decide to edit, compile, or use this code in any way, please respect the [license](). If you still ignore this warning then get ready for a **DISCORD ACCOUNT TERMINATION**
